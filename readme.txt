== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Fotobook isn't working, what's wrong? =

Before contacting me, make sure your host is running PHP 5.  If not, contact their support to see if it can be changed or switch to a [host](http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?275020/hosting.html|fotobook) that does have PHP 5.

= Can this plugin import photos from Facebook groups or pages? =

Not currently.

= How do I create a new style for Fotobook? =

To create a new style, simply duplicate and rename one of the existing styles and modify the files.

= My theme doesn't support widgets.  How do I add the Fotobook widgets manually? =

Use the following template functions:

`fb_photos_widget(count, mode, size)
fb_albums_widget(count, mode)`

*Parameters*

* $count: number of photos/albums to display (default: 4)
* $mode: method for selecting photos/albums to display.  Can either by random or recent
* $size: size of square thumbnails (default: 80)

*Examples*

`<?php fb_photos_widget(4, 'random', 80); ?>
<?php fb_albums_widget(5, 'recent'); ?>`

= I have the Lightbox style selected but the images pop up in another window. =

The [Lightbox plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/lightbox-2-wordpress-plugin/) must be installed and activated.  Try using the Colorbox style instead.

== Help Out! ==

To be honest, this takes up a lot of time. I enjoy doing it, but some money for it here and there would be nice.  Here are a few ways you can help out (and encourage me to work on it more =) ):

First, you could sign up for a [DreamHost](http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?275020/signup|fotobook) account and use the promo code Fotobook. This not only helps me out but also waives the $50 setup fee when you pay monthly (only $10.95/month). If you choose one of the other payment periods you’ll get $25.00 off. I’ve hosted with them for a couple years and I’ve had no problems. They have all sorts of [features](http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?275020/hosting.html|fotobook) (500gb storage, unlimited domains, PHP4&5) and, best of all, they have one-click WordPress installs and upgrades.

If you are satisfied with your hosting and want to help out, you can send some cash over [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&business=aaron%40freshwebs.net&item_name=Fotobook%20Donation&buyer_credit_promo_code=&buyer_credit_product_category=&buyer_credit_shipping_method=&buyer_credit_user_address_change=&no_shipping=0&no_note=1&tax=0&currency_code=USD&lc=US&bn=PP-DonationsBF&charset=UTF-8).
